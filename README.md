# TL;DR

Start by activating your workspace
```bash
./activate.sh example
```

Open IDE, it will contain all the needed tasks and launchers
```bash
code . &
```
Inside IDE press `F1`, pick `Task: Run Task` and choose between options, for example `build-debug`.

When the work is done, deactivate the workspace
```bash
./deactivate
```
